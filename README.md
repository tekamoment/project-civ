# project-civ

Mobile front-end component of Project Civ, a cross-platform citizen participation and awareness project.

This repository contains only the mobile component. The backend, which is built on Spring, is hosted in a separate private repository.

This app was created in 24 hours at the BlueHacks 2017 hackathon, hosted by the Computer Society of the Ateneo, and held at the Ateneo de Manlia University.

Project Civ was part of the Top Six finalists, out of a pool of over twenty projects created by students from various universities across Metro Manila.
